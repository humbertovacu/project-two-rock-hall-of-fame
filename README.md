This project was created in the frame of a Web Development’s bootcamp at Ironhack, for the module 2.

The requirements of the project: Create in pairs a Full-stack Web Application.

The name of the application is Rock Rock Rock. The name is a reference from the song “Puro Rock” created by the Mexican band called “Resorte”. The first name of the project was The Rock Hall of Fame, nevertheless, we decided to change the name because there is already an official Rock & Roll Hall of fame.
